# Open223 Documentation [![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://open223.github.io/docs.open223.info/)

ASHRAE standard 223P is a proposed standard that formally defines knowledge concepts for representing building system information such as the connections between mechanical equipment, spaces within a building, and their measurement and control points. It is a metadata schema and semantic ontology that defines the modeling constructs and rules needed to construct semantically interoperable, machine-readable semantic models that provide software applications the ability to determine essential information about the meaning and context of building data to support the deployment of various advanced features such as advanced building controls, fault detection and diagnostics, and automated commissioning.

The purpose of this user guide is to serve as a brief overview on how to interact with ASHRAE Standard 223P. The guide is designed to prime users with a basic understanding of the standard and several essential processes to 223P usage including building, validating, and querying 223P models. It also introduces some relevant tools and sample use cases to enable individuals to begin experimenting with the proposed standard.
