>1 PURPOSE
The purpose of this standard is to define formal knowledge concepts and a methodology to apply them to create interoperable, machine-readable semantic frameworks for representing building automation and control data, and other building system information
>
>2 SCOPE
This standard provides a comprehensive way to apply semantic formalisms to represent the context of building system data and relationships between the associated building mechanical system components so that software applications can find and understand the information in an automated way. It is intended to facilitate the development and implementation of building analytics tools and enterprise knowledge applications that can implement many building system functions, including:
>1. automated fault detection and diagnostics,
>2. building system commissioning,
>3. digital twins
>4. optimization of energy use, and
>5. smart grid interactions.

The purpose of this user guide is to serve as a brief overview on how to interact with ASHRAE Standard 223P. The guide is designed to prime users with a basic understanding of the standard and several essential processes to 223P usage including building, validating, and querying 223P models. It also introduces some relevant tools and sample use cases to enable individuals to begin experimenting with the proposed standard.

This User Documentation uses the Diataxis Framework[^2], which is organzed into the following sections.
