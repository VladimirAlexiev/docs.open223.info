# Introduction to ASHRAE 223P 

ASHRAE standard 223P is a proposed standard that formally defines knowledge concepts for representing building system information such as the connections between (pieces of) mechanical equipment, spaces within a building, and their measurement and control points. It is a metadata schema (semantic ontology?) that defines the modeling constructs and rules needed to construct semantically interoperable, machine-readable semantic models that provide software applications the ability to determine essential information about the meaning and context of building data to support the deployment of various advanced features such as advanced building controls, fault detection and diagnostics, and automated commissioning. 

For more information about the standard itself, check the 223p publication document (will this be available?) and website (link). 
Maybe mention external references/bacnet, though that has a section later
Beyond just the RDF representation, Standard 223 uses the SHACL (Shapes Constraint Language) (ref. https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) to specify the conformance requirements for using the defined classes and predicates in allowed ways. These requirements are specified using SHACL validation rules.
