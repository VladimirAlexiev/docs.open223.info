# ASHRAE Standard 223P
 
Standard 223P defines modeling constructs for use in creating a machine-readable representation of building systems, the building spaces that they serve, and the measurement and control points used to provide a safe and comfortable environment for the building occupants. The standard can be considered a toolkit of components and rules for using them to create a semantic model of a particular building or campus of buildings. The resulting model provides a way for software applications to determine the relationships between the mechanical equipment in the building (i.e., AHU 1 gets chilled water from CH 3 and provides conditioned air to VAV Boxes 12 through 15 serving rooms on the third floor) and the meaning of measurements that are available (i.e., T16 is a temperature sensor measuring the temperature of the air stream exiting AHU 1). This facilitates the implementation of advanced features like automated fault detection and diagnostics, supervisory controls, automated commissioning, and more. 


## Using Graph Data Concepts

Standard 223P is represented using the Resource Description Framework (RDF). RDF is a general method for representic semantic information in the form of a triple, which consists of a subject, a predicate, and an object. The subject and object define two entities, which are an instance of some class, and the predicate defines how they are related. A collection of these triples make up a graph. The ASHRAE 223P standard defines classes and relationships relevant to the building space that can then be used to build a multi-graph representing a specific building or group of buildings. For more information about RDF and the other semantic technologies used by the standard, please look at the [reference section](other-references).

To create a semantic model of your building using Standard 223P, you create instances that represent the entities in your building, and define them using the classes and relationships defined or referenced by Standard 223P. For example, you may be creating a model of a building in which your air handling unit (ahu-1) contains a fan (fan-1). Your air handling unit (ahu-1) would be modeled as an instance of the 223P class s223:AirHandlingUnit, which describes the general class of things resembling Air Handling Units. Similarly, your fan (fan-1) would be an instance of the 223P class s223:Fan. The idea of containment is defined using the 223P relationship s223:contains, so your air handling unit would relate to your fan using the relationship s223:contains. The relationship between an instance and a class is defined using the RDF relationship rdf:type, so your ahu and fan would relate to s223:AirHandlingUnit and s223:Fan using the relation rdf:type. This example is shown in Figure 1.
